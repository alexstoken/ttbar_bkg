#### Abstract
A data-driven approach is taken to estimate the background and find optimal cuts for the four-top-quark search at the ATLAS Experiment for <span>&#8730;</span>s = 13 TeV. Using 140fb<sup>-1</sup> of data generated from the Large Hadron Collider from 2015 through 2018, the Monte Carlo simulated background is reweighted by a function of H<sup>T</sup><sub>all</sub> to match the distribution of data. This correction function is then used to build MC signal and background distributions. To find the best region to search for the four-top signal, the significance of the signal to background is measured for various lower bounds, and the optimal selection criteria of N<sub>bjets</sub> >2 jets, N<sub>jets</sub> > 9 jets, H<sup>T</sup><sub>all</sub> >  660000 MeV, and jet<sub>pt</sub> > 60000 MeV are chosen. These cuts produce a significance of 1.0077 and yield 60.22 expected signal events and 3511 expected background events in the data sample.
